For x96 and Capstone project courses I helped develop a automated movement functions to be implemented in a Red Tweezers program. This program is ran via LabVIEW and Vision Acquisition. It uses video input to detect microscopic objects then generate and control the movement of microscopic actuators. My group is responsible for developing the movement algorithms that will be responsible for caging the detected object and moving it.
