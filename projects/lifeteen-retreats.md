As a youth minister at Our Lady of Help Parish in Ewa Beach, we are given the opportunity to have youth retreats in the Spring and Fall. I was given the opportunity to Co-direct the Fall retreat.

Together with two other youth ministers, we coordinated and prepared a team of other youth ministers for the retreat. We set the theme of the retreat, planned session topics, and assigned other ministers to teach for those sessions. We also controlled the logistics and correspondence with Camp Waianae and other vendors. Majority of the documentation and resource sharing was done via Google Drive. 

We also coordinated weekly meetings to discuss the retreat plans with the staff, in addition to give us more opportunities to fellowship with one another before the weekend. The retreats were held at Camp Waianae.
