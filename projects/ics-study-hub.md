## Overview

ICS Study Hub is a site where students can view study sessions created by other students. Each registered user is able to view current study sessions that can range from homework help to exam study sessions. The main idea of this website is to allow students to collaborate and meet with other students. There is also the possibility for users to reward points to one another so that top tutors or contributors can be rewarded for their helpfulness.
