summary: A website for students to find out about opportunities to collab and study with other students

## Project Overview

ICS Study Hub is a site where students can view study sessions created by other students. Each registered user is able to view current study sessions that can range from homework help to exam study sessions. The main idea of this website is to allow students to collaborate and meet with other students. There is also the possibility for users to reward points to one another so that top tutors or contributors can be rewarded for their helpfulness. 

## My Individual Contributions

My responsibilities for this project was to implement the landing page, user profile page, and updating the user data. I also assisted in expanding the user schema and updating the sign up page.

## My experience

My biggest takeaways from working on a project of this scale was how to develop as a team,  web application development, and expanding the tech stack I am familiar with. Working as a team with issue driven project management allowed me to experience what that methodology will be like in the work force. I also gained real experience in using Semantic UI React with Meteor to create a deployed application.
