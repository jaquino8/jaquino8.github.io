 ## The Basics
 
This was my first experience using a tech stack that is used for web development. As a computer engineer, I was not too familiar with the structure of web sites and how easy it was to inspect some of the code that is used for some web sites. When we began this module, I was excited to learn how to use these tools to gain more experience as a software engineer. There are so many jobs that are looking for people that have experience using these tools.

In the beginning of the module, we began working with regular html and CSS. The web sites we created were very plain looking and lacked the professional look that high quality web sites have. The freeCodecamp course gave a quick tutorial that gave a good base for understanding how to use these two tools. Then we jumped to the use of the Semantic UI framework that gave us the power to create a higher quality looking web site.
