## Setting the standards

In the famous words of Mike Tomlin, head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, "The standard is the standard". How exactly does this pertain to ESLint, JavaScript, or following coding standards? I am not sure. However, the statement by Coach Tomlin serves his players and staff as a reminder that there are standards which are applied to those who are professionals. As professionals, there is a higher expectation of skill and quality of what is produced. 

## Expectations

As for Software Engineering professionals, I believe that they are expected to produce code in a highly readible and efficient way. This would allow others who may not know the goal of the program to easily understand what is going on. If I were to see a program be able to complete a complicated task, I would be impressed. If I were to see a program be able to complete a complicated task AND be formatted in a way that was easy to understand, I would be impressed and extremely grateful.

As a student trying to improve my ability as a software engineer, I appreciate the coding standards. It allows me to format my program in a specific and consistent way. By applying the coding standards to my program, my portfolio will showcase my attention to detail and improve the overall quality of the programs I produce. 

## Lets get Linting
 
After my first week of using ESLint and IntelliJ, I appreciated using code quality tools while writing code. It was easy to make mistakes while typing and ESLint provided warnings to make sure I corrected those mistakes before I tested my program. ESLint also provided a reason why it was considering what I wrote as incorrect, and provided references to understand what was going on. ESLint also recommended changes to make my program more efficient and I could apply those changes with just a click of a button. To be able to understand why ESLint checks for these things improves my understanding of JavaScript. Overall, I feel that by continuing to use these standards I will improve my code quality, understanding of the programming language, and help others that may need to reference my code for some guidance.
