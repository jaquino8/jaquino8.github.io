## Setting the standards

In the famous words of Mike Tomlin, head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, "The standard is the standard". How exactly does this pertain to ESLint, JavaScript, or following coding standards? I am not sure. However, the statement by Coach Tomlin serves his players and staff as a reminder that there are standards which are applied to those who are professionals. As professionals, there is a higher expectation of skill and quality of what is produced. 

## Expectations

As for Software Engineering professionals, I feel that they are expected to produce code in highly readible and efficient way. This would allow others who may not know the goal of the program to easily understand what is going on. If I were to see a program be able to complete a complicated task, I would be impressed. If I were to see a program be able to complete a complicated task AND be formatted in a way that was easy to understand, I would be impressed and extremely grateful.

As a student trying to improve my ability as a software engineer, I appreciate the coding standards. It allows me to format my program in a specific and consistent way. By applying the coding standards to my program, my portfolio will showcase my attention to detail and improve the overall quality of the programs I produce.
