## The Basics
 
This was my first experience using a tech stack that is used for web development. As a computer engineer, I was not too familiar with the structure of web sites and how easy it was to inspect some of the code that is used for some web sites. When we began this module, I was excited to learn how to use these tools to gain more experience as a software engineer. There are so many jobs that are looking for people that have experience using these tools.

In the beginning of the module, we began working with regular HTML and CSS. The web sites we created were very plain looking and lacked the professional look that high quality web sites have. The freeCodecamp course gave a quick tutorial that gave a good base for understanding how to use these two tools. Then we jumped to the use of the Semantic UI framework that gave us the power to create a higher quality looking web site.

## Semantic UI

After viewing the PluralSight course about Semantic UI, I couldn't wait to use this framework to create some cool websites. While watching the lessons, I thought to myself, "Hey this isn't so bad, it actually looks pretty easy." and boy was I wrong. On the surface, Semantic UI uses a pretty simple syntax for defining classes. It is when you combine the different classes that it can get pretty complex. The combinations of containers, grids, menus, columns, rows, fluidity, and all other features that are included in the Semantic UI framework really allow the creator the freedom to mold the web site to any design they have in their mind. The ability to overwrite the default settings of those built in features allow even more creativity. 

## More power means more.. creativity!

I can see why companies are looking for people that have experience with these frameworks. Frameworks are powerful tools that give the creator the resources to create so much more than what regular HTML and CSS can provide. To be able to load up any web page and be able to recreate most (if not all) of what you see on the page show show powerful these frameworks are.
