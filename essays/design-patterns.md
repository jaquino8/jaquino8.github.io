## Thank the ninjas

Dr. Philip Johnson says, "Patterns help newbies acquire the hard-won experience of ninjas". I, a current newbie, would like to thank these ninjas for setting the foundations for the design patterns that we use today. The 1994 book *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*, also known as Gang of For (GoF) book for short, was created to provide a resource that defines and explains numerous design patterns that are used in object-oriented programming. Although this book was written years ago, a lot of the information within the book are still very relevant to today.
 
Design patterns are general solutions that can be modified and adapted to solve a problem or to achieve a goal within a program. Since problems or challenges are diverse, it is useful to have defined patterns that have been discovered by these experienced ninjas that allow us solve them.
