## Knowledge is power.
 
Knowledge is power. However, not knowing something does not make you weak. It gives you the opportunity to improve yourself and possibly empower those who try to aid you. This type of growth is not possible without being willing to ask for help. Although, just asking for help is not what is important, it is HOW you ask for help. After reading the essay "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric Raymond, the proper way to ask a question can not only provide an accurate answer for your problem, but also encourages others to answer. Simply put, just because you ask a question, it does not necessarily mean you will get an answer. However, if you ask the question in a proper way, the chances you will get a reply and the quality of your response will improve.
  
## Think before you speak

There are many prerequisites before even attempting to ask the question. According to Raymond, the very first step before posing a question is to do your own research beforehand. The amount of information and resources available today are so abundant that the probability of someone encountering the similar issues are high. Specifically, software engineering guides and issues are posted on multitudes of forums and discussion sites. Those who would have answered the question would be able to tell how much research you put into finding your own answer before asking the question. If your question provides enough evidence that you have attempted a solution yourself and done a fair share of searching for a solution, there should be enough information to share with potential answerers so that they me be more enticed to provide a solution. So what is the difference between a good question and a bad question?
