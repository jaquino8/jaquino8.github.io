  Knowledge is power. However, not knowing something does not make you weak. It gives you the opportunity to improve yourself and possibly empower those who try to aid you. This type of growth is not possible without being willing to ask for help. Although, just asking for help is not what is important, it is HOW you ask for help. After reading the essay "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric Raymond, the proper way to ask a question can improve your understanding and provides help to others who may be asking similar questions.
